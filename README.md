SoS implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for finding/classifying objects in astronomy data.

# TODO before initial release
* Flesh out codebase
* Define README sections

# Dependencies
TensorFlow (described [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/)) is the primary 
external dependency. This is the code base that implements the actual machine
learning components.

cfitsio ([here](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html)) is also 
required in order to create/update FITS files.

# Downloading


# Installing


# A quick example
To see an example of how to use the SoS library, please check out the tutorial
directory. You should start with `tutorial/Guide.md` for a walk-through of the
tutorial.

# For Developers
Please see the included guidelines in `Developers.md` file.
